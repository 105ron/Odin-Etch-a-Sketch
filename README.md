# Etch a Sketch

This project is an introduction to JQuery, JavaScript and to re-enforce the HTML5 and CSS skills learned on the [Google Home Page project](https://github.com/105ron/google-homepage). This project is a chance to break a problem down into little manageable steps and then figure out how to solve each step in turn. This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Web Development 101 track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery) for more information.
