# Etch a Sketch

This project is an introduction to JQuery, JavaScript and to re-enforce HTML5 and CSS skills learnt on the [Google homepage project](https://github.com/105ron/google-homepage). This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Web Development 101 track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery) for more information. This project is a chance to break a problem down into little manageable steps and then figure out how to solve each step in turn.
